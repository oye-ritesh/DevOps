Day 4 
DevOps 
DevOps is the solution for development and operation issue/problems. 
DevOps helps teams for communication, collaboration and integration.
DevOps aims to shorten the Software development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high quality software. 
________________________________________ 
SDLC: - Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process used to plan, design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain high-quality software.
 
Waterfall Model: –
The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential SDLC model where each phase must be completed before moving to the next phase. Once a phase is finished, changes are difficult to implement.

Agile Model: –
Agile is an iterative and incremental SDLC model where software is developed in small cycles called sprints, allowing continuous customer feedback and frequent releases.

DevOps: -
DevOps is a culture, methodology, and set of practices that integrates software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to enable faster, reliable, and continuous delivery of high-quality software through collaboration, automation, and monitoring.
Note: -
Waterfall is suitable for projects with fixed requirements, Agile works best for projects needing flexibility and continuous feedback, and DevOps is ideal for fast, automated, and continuous delivery in dynamic environments.
________________________________________

Code Management: –
Code management is the practice of tracking, controlling, and collaborating on software code using version control systems like Git and platforms like GitHub.
Note: Git is a tool used to track and manage code changes, while GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories online, allowing teams to collaborate, review code, and manage projects.

Continuous Delivery (CD): manual approval
Code is automatically built and tested, but production deployment needs manual approval.

Continuous Deployment: Fully automatic
Code is automatically built, tested, and deployed to production without any manual step.

________________________________________
DevOps Life Cycle: 
DevOps lifecycle is a continuous loop of planning, development, deployment, and monitoring using automation tools to deliver faster and reliable software.

   Plan –>Code –>Build –>Test –>Release –> Deploy –> Operate –>Monitor

 

1.	Plan – Requirement planning and tracking
Tools: Jira, Azure Boards

An Operating System is system software that acts as an interface between the user and computer hardware.
It manages CPU, memory, storage, files, devices, and processes and provides services for applications to run.
Examples: Windows, Linux, macOS, Unix
________________________________________
2. Linux is a Kernel – what does that mean?
Linux itself is only a kernel, not a full OS.
When the Linux kernel is combined with tools, libraries, and a shell, it becomes a Linux Operating System (distribution).
Examples of Linux OS: Ubuntu, Red Hat, CentOS, Debian

________________________________________
3. What is a Kernel?
The kernel is the core of the operating system that connects hardware with software, managing CPU, memory, storage, and devices so applications can run properly. 
Note:
•	The kernel runs in privileged mode and directly interacts with hardware.

________________________________________
4. What is a Shell?
A shell is a command-line interpreter that allows users to communicate with the kernel.
Role:
•	Takes user commands
•	Interprets them
•	Passes them to the kernel for execution
Common shells:
•	bash (Bourne Again Shell)
•	sh
•	zsh
•	csh

5. What is DOS? 
DOS (Disk Operating System) is a basic operating system that lets users interact with a computer using text-based commands.
It supports single user and single task at a time and was mainly used in early computers.
Key points:
•	Command-line based
•	No multitasking
•	Limited memory management
•	Mostly used in early PCs
Example: MS-DOS
________________________________________
6. What is Unix and Linux? (Difference)
Unix is a commercial, multi-user, multitasking operating system developed at AT&T Bell Labs.
It is not free, very stable and secure, and mainly used in enterprise servers.
•	Examples: AIX, Solaris, HP-UX

Linux is a free, open-source, Unix-like operating system developed by Linus Torvalds.
It supports multi-user and multitasking and is widely used in servers, cloud, and DevOps.
•	Examples: Ubuntu, Red Hat, CentOS
________________________________________
7. What is APT?
APT (Advanced Package Tool) is a package management system used in Debian-based Linux distributions.
Purpose:
•	Install software
•	Update packages
•	Resolve dependencies automatically
Example commands:
apt update
apt upgrade
apt install nginx
